# Basic Frontend (Angular + Tailwind)

Simple frontend demo that allows user registration, login (stored in localStorage), and viewing an Eiffel Tower image.

Quick start:

```bash
cd Basic-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Notes:
- This is a frontend-only demo. Auth is stored in `localStorage` for demonstration only (not secure).
- Tailwind is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
